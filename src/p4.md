To create a **Python web scraper** that runs as an **MCP server** and interacts with an **Ollama client** using **FastMCP** and **agent-to-agent protocols** (with agent card, JRPC, and SSE), follow these steps:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

You'll need the following Python packages:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 fastmcp ollama
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create the Web Scraper (MCP Server)

This script will act as an MCP server, scraping data from a website:

```python
from fastmcp import MCPServer
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

class WebScraperServer(MCPServer):
    def scrape(self, url: str) -> str:
        """Scrapes the given URL and returns text content."""
        response = requests.get(url)
        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
        return soup.get_text()

server = WebScraperServer()
server.register_tool("scrape", server.scrape)
server.run()
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Create the Ollama Client

This client will send requests to the MCP server and process responses using Ollama:

```python
from mcp_client_for_ollama import MCPClient

client = MCPClient(server_url="http://localhost:5000")

url = "https://example.com"
response = client.call_tool("scrape", url)
print("Scraped Content:", response)
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Server & Client

1. Start the MCP server:

   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

2. Run the Ollama client:

   ```bash
   python client.py
   ```

This setup allows your **Ollama-powered client** to interact with an **MCP-based web scraper** efficiently! üöÄ Would you like to add more features, such as structured data extraction?
