### Common Installation Issues

#### 1. Git Clone Issue

If you encounter issues while cloning the repository, ensure that your Git version is up-to-date.

```bash
git clone --version
```

You can update to the latest version by running:

```bash
git upgrade
```

Additionally, try cloning the repository again with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/charudatta10/ai-agent.git --depth 1 --recurse-submodules
```

### Configuration Problems

#### 1. Incorrect Environment Variable Setting

Ensure that the `.env` file is correctly set in your environment variables.

For example, if you're using Python, ensure that `AI_AGENT_TOKEN` and `AI_AGENT_API_KEY` are defined:

```python
import os

# Set environment variable values from .env file
os.environ["AI_AGENT_TOKEN"] = "your_token_value"
os.environ["AI_AGENT_API_KEY"] = "your_api_key_value"
```

#### 2. Docker Configuration Issue

Make sure that your `Dockerfile` is correctly configured.

For example, if you're using the Ollama framework:

```dockerfile
FROM olly:latest

# Copy required files to the image
COPY requirements.txt /app/requirements.txt
COPY . /app/

# Install dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r /app/requirements.txt

# Expose the port used by the Ollama framework
EXPOSE 8080

# Run the command to start the AI agent
CMD ["python", "main.py"]
```

### Usage Questions

#### 1. How do I run the project?

To run the project, navigate to the project directory and execute:

```bash
invoke
```

This will start the AI agent using the `main.py` file.

#### 2. What is the purpose of the `.env` file?

The `.env` file stores sensitive configuration values such as API keys, tokens, or other credentials. Ensure that these values are properly set to avoid any authentication issues.

### Troubleshooting Tips

#### 1. Git Clone Failed with Error Message

If you encounter an error message during the cloning process, try updating your Git version and retrying:

```bash
git upgrade
```

Also, check if there's a network issue or if the repository is temporarily unavailable.

#### 2. Docker Container Not Starting

If the Docker container doesn't start, ensure that your `Dockerfile` is correctly configured and that the required dependencies are installed.

Try debugging the issue by checking the Docker logs:

```bash
docker logs -f <container_id>
```
